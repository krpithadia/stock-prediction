Stock Prediction Project:

Welcome to the Stock Prediction Project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to predict future stock prices using machine learning models. The project uses historical stock data to train models that forecast stock prices for selected companies, particularly focusing on Indian stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Reliance Industries (Reliance), and State Bank of India (SBI).

Features
Data Acquisition: Fetches historical stock data using the yfinance library.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and performs feature engineering, including moving averages and daily returns.

Model Building: Utilizes machine learning models like Linear Regression to predict future stock prices.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted stock prices for easy comparison.

Future Predictions: Predicts the next day's closing price based on the latest available data.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, yfinance

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib yfinance
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction.git
cd stock-prediction
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Script:

bash
python stock_prediction.py
The script will fetch data, preprocess it, build and evaluate the model, visualize the results, and predict the next day's closing price for the selected stocks.

Project Structure
stock_prediction.py: Main script containing the logic for data acquisition, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage details, and other information.

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

Explanation of the Code
The project follows a structured approach to predict stock prices:

Data Acquisition: Using the yfinance library, historical stock data is fetched for the selected companies.

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, and new features like moving averages and daily returns are created. The target variable is defined as the next day's closing price.

Defining Features and Target Variable: Key features are selected, and the target variable is set to the future closing price.

Splitting the Data: The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Scaling the Features: Features are normalized to ensure they are on a similar scale.

Building and Training the Model: A Linear Regression model is used to train the data.

Making Predictions: The model makes predictions on the test set.

Evaluating the Model: Performance metrics like MAE and RMSE are calculated to assess the model.

Visualizing the Results: Actual vs. predicted prices are plotted.

Predicting Future Prices: The model predicts the next day's closing price based on the latest data.
